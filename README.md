# Najada Feimi Simple Pipeline
## Introduction
This is a simple pipeline I created for the workshop "Statec" of my Master Degree in Data Science. 

My workflow:

First I created a package called MyPackage which can be found at this repository: [https://github.com/NajadaFeimi/MyPackage](https://github.com/NajadaFeimi/MyPackage)
This package has three functions in it and they all work with the free dataset diamonds
* fit_model ##### fits a linear model to the diamonds dataframe where price is the dependent variable and carat is the independent variable
* plot_model ##### displays a scatterplot of the fitted model 
* plot_stats ##### plots a jitter boxplot where the jitter datapoint show the relation between carats and the price for each diamond cut and the boxplot shows the distribution
